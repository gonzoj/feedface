### FEEDFACE - A story of crushed hopes and shattered dreams

This is the sum of my reverse engineering efforts for Diablo III piled into one ugly source file.

Back in 2012 I started reverse engineering the beta client for Diablo III (Patch 15 I believe). I ended up having a working maphack and planned on eventually extending it into a sophisticated platform that would allow automation and modification of the game. However, I stopped playing the game soon after its release and lost motivation to continue working on this project.
